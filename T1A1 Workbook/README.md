## Q1. Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages

## Q2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet. Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

- packets
  
  Packets are distributing messages by chopping up big messages into smaller pieces to pass these through flexible routes with spare capacity. This was to solve the issue of big files transferring causing links to be tied up in the process. This allows for efficiency and fault-tolerant. (reference computer networks youtube)

  An example of when we see corrupt or missing packets would be when skype gets glitchy during a meeting. It has discarded some of the UDP. 5:15 to clean up on (The internet youtube)

 - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
  
  Packets must conform to a standard format called an internet protocol or 'IP'. (reference computer networks youtube).Every message requires an address of destination which is an IP Header. In addition each message has a weight limit per packet, which is why it is broken up. Each computer connected to a network receives an IP address. (reference computer networks youtube). Each packet has destination address on the network so routers know where to forward them. The packet also requires the User Datagram Protocol which has extra information including a port number to direct the packets information to the correct program running and a checksum to check the data. (reference youtube the internet)

 - routers and routing
  
  Routing is adding a communication line between computer networks. The technology of routing has developed from a physical switch board called circut switching. Another is message switching which has the message move between different stops by routing... hop count. ... Create flexiblity, reduction of costs, exclusivity, reduce routing errors from hop count/limit?. Speedy and reliable delivery by bouncing between different routes using congestion control. 

  Packet switching is a routing approach of using packets. Creates Desentialised or single point of failure.

 - domains and DNS
  
  Domains are... Domains are used to reduce collisions of data being transmitted from one to another. When you have a few computers on one shared ethernet cable, or one collision domain.. or two collision domain. This is how computer networks are constructed including the internet.

  ## Q3. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet.Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

   - TCP

Transmission Control Protocol. When messages cannot handle dropping any packets whilst transferring a message to a program. Contains destination port checksum and .. Suquenstial numbers of the packets, allow for receiving computer to put it in order - piece together correctly. Once receive packet and data passes the checksum it sends back an acknloedgement to sending computer. Sender will then next packet. Duplicates discarded. Sends many packets even with outstanding acknowledgements which increases bandwith as it's not waiting on direct communication. TCP adjusts rate of packets being sent by it's rate of sending and acknowledging which allows for congestion control. Used for time critical applications like multi player computer games to avoid lag. (youtube the internet)
  Packets arriving out of order. TCP/IP

 - HTTP and HTTPS
 - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)
