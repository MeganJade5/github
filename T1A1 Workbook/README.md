answer here. 

## Q2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet. Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

- packets
  Packets are chopping up big messages into smaller pieces to pass these through flexible routes with spare capacity. This was to solve the issue of big files transferring causing links to be tied up in the process. This allows for efficiency and fault-tolerant. (reference computer networks youtube)
 - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
  a standard format called an internet protocol or 'IP'. Each computer connected to a network receives and IP address. Each packet has destination address on the network so routers know where to forward them. (reference computer networks youtube)
 - routers and routing
  Routing is adding a communication line between computer networks. The technology of routing has developed from a physical switch board called circut switching. Another is message switching which has the message move between different stops by routing... hop count. ... Create flexiblity, reduction of costs, exclusivity, reduce routing errors from hop count/limit?. Speedy and reliable delivery by bouncing between different routes using congestion control. 

  Packet switching is a routing approach of using packets. Creates Desentialised or single point of failure.

 - domains and DNS
  Domains are... Domains are used to reduce collisions of data being transmitted from one to another. When you have a few computers on one shared ethernet cable, or one collision domain.. or two collision domain. This is how computer networks are constructed including the internet.

  internet of things - keeping up with growth?

   - TCP
  Packets arriving out of order. TCP/IP
